    <string name="tutorial">How to Play: Telephonia is based on the classic game of telephone involving
        friends sharing a word from person to person until the last person reveals what he thinks the word is.
        In our mobile setting, the game involves a group of friends connecting to each other and receiving an
        order to play the game. The first person received a word from our online dictionary, and must share a
        maximum 10 letter string of words that do not contain any of the letters from the previous word. This
        will continue until the last person shares what he thinks the original word was based on the string
        that he got. At the end, each player scores the rest of the lobby and the final scores are averaged
        to assign each player a score. Remember that this means there is an honor system involved, please
        refrain from cheating.</string>
